> Designed and implemented a 24-hour Real-Time Clock (RTC) using Verilog HDL. The digital clock tracks hours, minutes, and seconds in a 24-hour format and resets after reaching 23:59:59.  
>  
> A custom testbench was written to simulate the design in **QuestaSim**, with time output displayed using `$display` statements in the simulation transcript.  
>  
> The waveform was verified for correct rollover of seconds, minutes, and hours, ensuring functional accuracy of the timing logic.  
>  
> **Tools Used:**  
> - Verilog HDL  
> - QuestaSim (ModelSim)  
> - Vivado (optional synthesis)  
> - GTKWave (optional for VCD viewing)  
>  
> This project showcases core digital design skills including FSM design, counters, and testbench creation for simulation verification.
